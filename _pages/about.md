I am a PhD student and Cambridge Gates scholar working with Guillaume Hennequin in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab at the University of Cambridge.
We work on developing Bayesian machine learning tools for analysing neural population recordings as well as applying these tools to diverse neural circuits involved in navigation, cognition, motor control and more.
In collaboration with Marco Tripodi at the Labotoratory of Molecular Biology, we also investigate how space is represented in subcortical sensorymotor circuits, and we have developed methods for analyzing such representations in non-Euclidean spaces.
In addition to our neuroscience research, CBL is home to a range of excellent Machine Learning researchers, and we are always interested in thinking about new ways of applying neuroscience to machine learning and vice versa.

Prior to my PhD, I worked with Bence Ã–lveczky at Harvard Center for Brain Science as part of my MPhil in Computational Biology, and with Vivek Jayaraman at Janelia Research Campus as a Janelia Undergraduate Scholar (see projects and publications for details).
Before moving into neuroscience, I graduated with a BA in Natural Sciences from Cambridge where I did courses and research in both molecular biology and theoretical chemistry, and I continue to be interested in interdisciplinary research spanning the biological and physical sciences.
