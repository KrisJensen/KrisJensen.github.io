I am a PhD student and Cambridge Gates scholar working with Guillaume Hennequin in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab at the University of Cambridge.
We have recently worked on a suite of Bayesian machine learning tools for analysing neural population recordings which we apply to diverse circuits involved in navigation, cognition, motor control etc. in order to better understand how neural circuit dynamics give rise to biological function.
We have also developed new approaches for continual learning inspired by principles of Bayesian inference, and I have worked with the Ölveczky lab at the Harvard Center for Brain Science to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of continual learning and the persistence of memories in biological motor circuits.
Currently, I am interested in how humans and animals generalize to new tasks and adapt to changing environments, and together with Marcelo Mattar, we are using a combination of theory and experiments to investigate how model-based planning might facilitate our ability to adapt.
In addition to our neuroscience research, CBL is home to a range of excellent Machine Learning researchers, and we are always interested in thinking about new ways of applying neuroscience to machine learning and vice versa.

Prior to my PhD, I worked with the Ölveczky lab as part of my MPhil in Computational Biology, and with Vivek Jayaraman at Janelia Research Campus as a Janelia Undergraduate Scholar (see projects and publications for details).
Before moving into neuroscience, I graduated with a BA in Natural Sciences from Cambridge where I did courses and research in both molecular biology and theoretical chemistry, and I continue to be interested in interdisciplinary research spanning the biological and physical sciences.

## Experimental paradigm to study planning in biological and artificial agents

<div><p>Try and play the game ↓ (you will need a keyboard...) You have 20 seconds to explore the maze (which has cyclic boundaries), find the hidden reward, get teleported, and go back to the reward as many times as you can. At the end of the 20s, a new environment will be generated with a new hidden reward location and you can do all this again (again again!).</p>
<p>(If using the up/down arrows annoyingly also scolls the page, try holding the Shift key at the same time.)</p>
