I am a Senior Research Fellow in the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL, where I work with Professor Timothy Behrens.
The focus of my research is to use computational and mathematical approaches to investigate the neural computations underlying flexible behaviour and decision making in changing environments.
This work is strongly inspired by seminal mechanistic research on the fruit fly brain, which I was fortunate enough to briefly work on with Vivek Jayaraman as a Janelia Undergraduate Scholar.
Prior to my postdoc, I was a PhD student and Cambridge Gates scholar with Guillaume Hennequin in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab at the University of Cambridge.
We developed a suite of Bayesian machine learning tools for analysing neural population recordings in order to better understand how neural circuit dynamics give rise to biological function.
We also developed new approaches for continual learning inspired by principles of Bayesian inference, and I previously worked with the Ölveczky lab at the Harvard Center for Brain Science to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of continual learning and the persistence of memories in biological motor circuits.
Finally, we investigated how humans and animals generalize to new tasks and adapt to changing environments in collaboration with Marcelo Mattar at NYU.
Before moving into neuroscience, I worked as both a molecular biologist and a theoretical chemist, and I continue to be interested in interdisciplinary research spanning the biological and physical sciences.
