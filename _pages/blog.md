Bayesian correction of systematic reviewer bias
</a>

{: style="text-align: justify" }
We rely increasingly on large-scale conferences for distributing our research and even assessing the quality of researchers. Unfortunately we don't have infinite review resources. However, we can treat the network of reviewers and papers as a big graph, taking into account interactions between reviewers of the same papers to fit a Bayesian model that takes into account systematic biases when assessing the quality of papers.
